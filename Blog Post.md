<h1 id="my-life-as-a-plant-mom">My Life as a Plant Mom</h1>
<p>Before all of this quarentine buissness started happening- I did not own a single hourseplant. However, in two short months I have added five new green buddies to my very small living quarters and attempted to grow broccoli from seed.</p>
<p>You may wonder what event spurred this obsession, this newfound love for plants, perhaps I came across a Peace Lily or an Azeala and was so moved by the beauty and fragility of life? Or maybe I had a vision from a diety that revealed itself to me as a large oak tree and said I could do my part by buying out the entire Home Depot gardening section? (ok that last one was a little far fetched even for me) As much as I’d like to give you some noble cause that makes you think, ‘Wow! That girl must really be in tune with nature!’<br>
I cannot. The real culprits of my foray into plants were impluse shopping and a lack of inital knowledge about plants.</p>
<p>On the day I bought my first plant I was headed to the grocery store to buy food, as one does, when I saw a girl walking through the store with a spider plant in her cart. I thought to myself, ‘I didn’t know they sold those here,’ followed almost immediatly by, I <strong>must</strong> have one of those. So I left that day with my very first houseplant.</p>

<p>After losing hours of productivity and sleep to gardening blogd and YouTube videos, ending up on some strange website about ‘Fun with Compost,’ and taking <em>ENDLESS</em> notes I realized two things;</p>
<ol>
<li>Planting from seed is not as easy as it seems.</li>
<li>I definetly did <em>not</em> have the infastructure in my tiny apartment to recreate the entire produce section of the grocery store.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was horrified to learn that I couldn’t just grab any 'ol dirt from outside, throw my seeds in it and call it a day! No matter, armed with my credit card and the Home Depot website I quickly attempted to recitfy the situation by buying organic seed starter, seed trays, grow lights, heating pads, Miracle Grow and potting soil. Three hundred plus dollars later I was convinced I had everything that I need to set my plants up for success! (Ok looking at it now I realize that I may have a problem with using retail as a form of therapy, but we’re headed straight for a reccession folks! I’m just doing my part by situlating the economy! And if the Home Depot goes under I will be distraught!) Anyway, I digress, while I’m at the Home Depot picking up supplies I come across a small Fiddle Leaf Fig, some quick google searches pull up giant magestic plants such as;</p>

<p>As I’m looking at this tiny shrub in front of me all I can think is, ‘It’s gonna be so cool when mine gets that big!’ So after another impulse buy, and a IKEA run to get a planter, I come home with my FIddle Fig and the beginnings of my gardening journey.</p>
